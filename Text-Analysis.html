                In Pieces of Eight by Steve Goble, the author explores the theme of the consequences of one's actions, 
                voluntary or involuntary, through the use of foreshadowing. Through the story of Spider John, the protagonist, 
                the author showcases how the choices and events in his life have led to significant outcomes.

                The first piece of evidence, "Just don't be surprised, Spider, if she isn't what you think her to be. People change, 
                and you have been gone a long time,‚Äù foreshadows the changes that have taken place in Spider's family while he has 
                been gone. This line shows that Spider's long absence has affected his relationship with his loved ones, implying 
                that his actions have consequences beyond just himself. It highlights the theme of the text that your actions, 
                whether voluntary or involuntary, have major consequences, as Spider is about to experience the consequences of 
                leaving his family for nearly a decade. In particular, his wife, Em, has been forced to turn to prostitution in 
                order to provide for their family. Furtemore Goble states "Spider, we'll find Margaret." Margaret was the name of
                the ship his wife boarded when escpaing to England. Spider spending nearly a decade at affected her so much she decided
                to leave to England after years of hardship. This further emphasizes the theme that one's actions, whether intentional or not, 
                have far-reaching consequences.

            <p class="Text-Analysis-text">
                Through the use of foreshadowing, Steve Goble effectively conveys the central idea that your actions, whether voluntary 
                or involuntary, have major consequences. He uses this writing strategy to create suspense and uncertainty in the reader, 
                and to build a deeper understanding of the protagonist's experiences and the impact of his choices. Pieces of Eight is a
                 historical adventure that explores this theme in an engaging and thought-provoking way, leaving the reader with much to 
                 reflect upon long after the story ends.
