                Pieces of Eight by Steve Goble is a historical adventure that follows the life of former pirate, Spider John. 
                The book had a lot of promise with the back summary painting a picture of a thrilling journey full of action and mystery. 
                However, the reality was far from what was promised. The book starts off with the murder of Calvin Garrick, a seemingly nice
                man who kept to himself. This event was interesting and held some promise of a captivating murder mystery, but it quickly became 
                clear that the rest of the book was not going to live up to the initial excitement. The writing was solid and the characters were well-defined, 
                but the plot felt lackluster and lacked the level of excitement promised in the back summary.

                The mystery surrounding the murder of Calvin Garrick was intriguing and held promise, but it was not enough to carry the rest of the book. 
                The investigation was well thought out, but lacked a real sense of urgency as the lack of interest in Stoneham's death took away from the 
                overall excitement. The attention to historical detail was appreciated, but it was not enough to compensate for the lack of thrilling events.
                Additionally, the characters were not as fleshed out as they could have been, leaving them feeling a little flat and uninteresting. The dialogue 
                was also not as engaging as I had hoped, and felt a little stilted at times. While there were some interesting moments, such as the exploration 
                of Nantucket and the investigation of the murder, the rest of the book felt slow and lacking in excitement. It is worth noting that this is the 
                fourth book in the series, so it is possible that readers who are familiar with the previous books in the series may find more enjoyment in 
                "Pieces of Eight." However, as someone who has not read the other books in the series, I found this installment to be a bit of a letdown compared 
                to what was promised by the back summary.

                Overall, I would say that "Pieces of Eight" was an okay read. Despite the misleading back summary, there were still some elements of the book that 
                were enjoyable. The historical setting and the inclusion of real-life pirate events and figures added an interesting layer to the story. Additionally, 
                the resolution of Calvin Garrick's murder was well done and provided a satisfying conclusion to that aspect of the story. However, the lack of excitement 
                and adventure promised in the back summary was a major disappointment. In the end, if you're a fan of historical adventures with a slower pace and a 
                focus on solving a murder, then this book might be worth a read. But if you're looking for a thrilling pirate adventure with a lot of action, you may want 
                to look elsewhere.
