            <p>
                In Pieces of Eight by Steve Goble, readers embark on a thrilling historical adventure 
                with former pirate, Spider John. After nine long and arduous years at sea, Spider returns 
                home, but not before facing one final challenge. Tragedy strikes when a crew member, 
                Calvin Garrick, falls to his death, leading to suspicions of murder and a potential 
                hijacking attempt. With the help of his friend Hob, Spider stops the hijacking and is rewarded. 
                He sets sail for Nantucket, where he left his family years ago, only to be accused of murder 
                upon arrival. With the help of his friends, Spider investigates the truth and ultimately discovers
                a sinister plot by his own in-laws to kill him.

            <h3> Words from the Author </h3>
            <p>
                "I love swords, pirates and murder mysteries, and have combined all that in my tales of Spider John, a good man 
                caught up in a life of piracy and solving murders as he tries to get himself free. I also write novels about a 
                rural Ohio sheriffâ€™s detective named Ed Runyon. Look for the debut of that series, CITY PROBLEMS, in July 2021. 
                My blog, Swords Against Boredom, is at stevegoble.com. P.S. Godzilla is my spirit animal."
